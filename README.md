# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data in Oahu in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. The investor wanted a deeper analysis for the months of June and December, so this we performed an analysis for those specific months.

- The average temperature in June was 74.9 vs 71.0 in December. As expected, June has a higher average temperature, but not by much.
- Surprisingly, the max temperatures of June vs. December did not differ by much. A high of 85 degrees was seen in June, and 83 degrees in December.
- The biggest difference was the low temperature of the months. June had a low of 64 degrees, while December had a low of 56 degrees.

## Summary

The analysis shows us that an ice cream surf shop in Oahu could be a business that can operate year round. With more variable weather in December, the business can expect a decrease in revenue, but it should still be operational.

In order to explore this analysis further, I would like to see data relating to precipitation and UV index. Adding precipitation and UV index data to this analysis would allow investors to be more confident in this business model.
